KSSE Structural Engineers,1500000,A very professional Masonry work specifically when you have to place the last brick@GIMS,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXYWEmhdOus,"Masonry is the building of structures from individual units, which are often laid in and bound together by mortar; the term masonry can also refer to the units themselves. The common materials of masonry construction are brick, building stone such as marble, granite, and limestone, cast stone, concrete block, glass block, and adobe. Masonry is generally a highly durable form of construction. However, the materials used, the quality of the mortar and workmanship, and the pattern in which the units are assembled can substantially affect the durability of the overall masonry construction. A person who constructs masonry is called a mason or bricklayer. These are both classified as construction trades. for more information check it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonry",
KSSE Structural Engineers,1500000,This is how wind turbines work and produce power@ Sustainable Green Energy system,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z75B0Dla7fM,"Wind turbines are devices that convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy and then into electrical energy. They are used to generate electricity from the renewable resource of wind power. Here's a basic explanation of how wind turbines work:

Blade Structure: Wind turbines have large rotor blades, typically made of lightweight materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber. The number of blades can vary, but most modern turbines have three.

Wind Capture: The turbine is positioned high above the ground to capture the most wind energy. When the wind blows, it impacts the blades, causing them to rotate.

Rotor and Shaft: The rotating blades are connected to a central shaft. As the blades turn, they spin the rotor, which is attached to the shaft. The shaft is designed to rotate at a relatively low and constant speed regardless of wind speed.

Gearbox or Direct Drive: Some wind turbines use a gearbox to increase the rotational speed of the rotor, which is necessary to operate the generator efficiently. However, newer designs called direct-drive turbines eliminate the gearbox and directly connect the rotor to the generator.

Generator: The mechanical energy from the rotating shaft is then transferred to a generator, which is essentially an electromagnet surrounded by a coil of wire. As the shaft rotates the electromagnet, it induces a flow of electric current in the wire coil. This process converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy.

Power Transmission: The electricity generated by the wind turbine is typically in the form of alternating current (AC). Before it can be used in homes and businesses, it needs to be converted to a higher voltage and sent through power lines for distribution to the electrical grid.

Wind Vane and Controller: To optimize energy generation and protect the turbine from excessive wind speeds, a wind vane and controller are often used. The wind vane determines the direction of the wind, and the controller adjusts the turbine's orientation to face into the wind for maximum efficiency. When wind speeds become too high, the controller can also stop the turbine to prevent damage.

Grid Connection: Wind turbines are usually part of a wind farm, where multiple turbines are installed in the same location. The electrical output from all the turbines is combined and sent to the electrical grid for distribution to consumers.

It's important to note that wind turbines require consistent wind speeds within a specific range to generate significant electricity. They are most effective in areas with consistent and strong winds, such as coastal regions or open plains. Proper maintenance and monitoring are also essential to ensure their optimal performance and longevity.",

If youâ€™re looking for a molecular modeling kit, try Snatoms, a kit I invented where the atoms snap together magnetically - https://ve42.co/SnatomsV 

Note: From construction images of Citicorp, sharp-eyed viewers might see that the mid-V columns are still there. Those columns help prevent buckling of the diagonal and the weight of people on the floor above, but do not take the majority of the gravity load. So we left them out of our diagram to clearly explain the load paths. See page 70 of this source for more details - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ODFo66-_V7Y9vKANbj53mQ0z20RZ2Uai/view
